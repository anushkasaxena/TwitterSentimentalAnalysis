# TwitterSentimentalAnalysis
# Project Name- Twitter sentimental analysis
# Abstract
The project aims to build twitter sentimental analysis. By using Natural language processing, tweets are classified as positive and negative. The models used for classifying are Naive bayes and Random forest classifier.
# What I have done?
I have taken dataset from kaggle. Then, data is preprocessed and by using Natural Language Processing, tweets are processed. Naives bayes and Random forest classifier models are used for the prediction that the tweets are negative or positive. 
# How I have done?
Loaded the dataset in the file. Data is then preprocessed and the tweets are processed by using Natural language processing
The models used are Na√Øve bayes and Random forest classifier. 
Using these models, prediction is done for the tweets, whether the tweet is negative or positive.
Then, all evaluating parameters and confusion matrix obtained.
# Result achieved
The sentimental analysis of twitter has been done using the model.

By Naive Bayes -:
Accuracy = 0.9432,
Precision = 0.6196,
Recall score = 0.4420,
F1 score = 0.5160

By Random Forest -:
Accuracy = 0.9589,
Precision = 0.8969,
Recall score = 0.4512,
F1 score = 0.6004
